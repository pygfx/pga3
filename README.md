# PGA3

This library provides Proper Geometry Algorithms, for doing geometry in 3D as the math-gods intended.

Psst ... if you're a math-person, this library implements Projective
Geometric Algebra in 3D (i.e. `‚Ñù(3, 0, 1)`), so that intersections and
joins etc. are super easy to implement, and benefit from all the
nicities of this algebra. But I don't want to scare our users, so we provide
an API that normal humans can actually understand.


### Status

Experimental and work in progress. I dug into this to see if it's
something we could use in pygfx. I'm not sure yet. This state matches
my progress (and understanding) so far.


### Benefits of this library (over libs that use linalg)

* Small size (once we have the algebra set up, all conversions, intersections etc. are one-liners).
* Transformations (translation + rotations) can be composed with minimal loss of precision (in contrast to composing multiple 4x4 matrices).
* Transformations are "linear", in that you can multiply them, e.g. to get smooth interpolation.
* Less need for checks and exceptions: intersecting two parallel lines? Fine! The result is a point at infinity (a direction)!
* No implicit design decisions like right-handed vs left-handed.


### Diving into the algebra

This lib attempts to provide a way to use a very cool/advanced/new
mathematical tool (3D PGA) without having to know about it.
